# Industrial Copper Modeling

This web application allows you to predict the selling price and status for industrial copper based on the given input parameters. The application uses machine learning models trained on the data to provide accurate predictions.


## Skills
1.Python
2.Streamlit
3.Scikit-learn
4.Pandas
## Work flow
Data Cleaning: Change the data types and remove the unwanted columns

EDA: Chech the releationship between feature and target and skewness.

Remove outliers.

Check the correlation

Model and Data: The predictive models (selling price and status) are trained machine learning models.

The models are loaded from pre-trained pickle files, which contain the trained model objects.

The input data is preprocessed using the standard scaler and one-hot encoder, as loaded from separate pickle files.

     
## Uses

This web application can be used to get quick and accurate predictions for selling price and status based on the input parameters. It can be useful for businesses in the industrial copper industry to make informed decisions and plan their operations accordingly.
